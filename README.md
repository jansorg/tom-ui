# tom-ui
tom-ui is a simple Qt5-based frontend for the [tom](https://github.com/jansorg/tom) time tracking cli.

It's developed to not interrupt the work and to be as less hassle as possible. It will support many features of the 
command-line client `gotime`.
It's not going to be a fully featured time-tracking application.

## Installation
At this time it's not yet available for download. It can be build with `cmake`.

## Features
### Tray icon
The tray icon displays the recently used projects for a quick start of a new activity.

### Project tree

### Times frames list

## License
To be decided, probably GPL.
